Note: It is not recommended that you use SkyblockCatia either since that mod has a bunch of incompatibilities with other mods and has a bunch of features that aren't even for skyblock, making it the bloatiest mod I've ever seen. Also the config menu is literal hell.

# Reasons NOT to Buy or Use SBE:
- [**Shitty puzzle solvers v1**](https://imgur.com/a/2xcDUBN)
- [**Shitty features v1**](https://imgur.com/a/zvNFdU2)
- [**Shitty features v2**](https://imgur.com/a/HPwYXeT)
- [**Crashes v1**](https://imgur.com/a/nXh749Y)
- [**Crashes v2**](https://imgur.com/a/4sey1HD)
- [**Shit code v1**](https://imgur.com/a/GpDBSns)
- [**Obfuscated to fuck**](https://imgur.com/a/41aSbvw) 
    - Context: This means we cant read the code unless we spend hours decrpyting it. This means that the mod is really unsafe as it can do anything such as pulling a JED and no one would know. It also makes it very easy for Complex to hide the fact that he steals code (more on this later). Also if you crash, no one fuckin knows why because the crashlog is just spam of iIiIiIiiIIiIiiIiIiiiIiIiIiIiiIiiiiIIIiiIiIiiIiiIiIiiIiiIiii, but at least it becomes clear how shitty SBE is and that it's what's causing the crash.
- [**Spams the fuck out of your logs v1**](https://imgur.com/a/xQm7jeN) (no one is going to want to help you after this)
- [**Spams the fuck out of your logs v2**](https://imgur.com/a/zanoqTA) (i dont understand how you can fuck up this badly)
- [**Spams the fuck out of your logs v3**](https://imgur.com/a/tFODSqR) (its not even funny anymore)
- [**Spams the fuck out of your logs v4**](https://imgur.com/a/ZqTvjuf) (it's just depressing at this point)
- **Blatantly steals from DSM** (can't find screenshot but its the tic tac toe solver, it's literally the same thing, even printed the exact same log messages)
- [**Blatantly steals from SBC**](https://imgur.com/a/TpkgDGU)
- [**Blatantly steals from Patcher**](https://imgur.com/a/rjNF5aT) 
    - Context: When patcher 1.5 was in beta and 1.12 crop hitboxes were added, they were bugged and were pretty broken. When Complex "made" his version, he somehow managed to produce the exact same fuckin bug. Fishy. Then Moulberry came in and fixed the glitch, and not soon after, Complex also magically found out how to fix it. The chance that they both had the exact same bug is really low.
- [**Blatantly steals from NEU**](https://imgur.com/a/wqA6KZA) 
    - Context: NEU had originally made a feature that allowed you to retexture skulls with custom models. On the SBE discord, they had specifically stated that they will not be stealing features from other mods and people should not request them to add stolen features, yet they still pull this shit? At the time Moulberry was pretty pissed at SBE for blatantly stealing features and was saying on stream he was going to add dungeon puzzle solvers to make SBE useless which was when they put out that statement, but when Moulberry decided against dungeon puzzle solvers, they went straight back to stealing. Absolute losers.
- **Blatantly steals from Skytils**
    - Added necron phase timers literally the day after skytils did. Complex also stalks the Skytils github, most likely looking for code/features to steal, which is just scummy.
- [**Breaks MC EULA**](https://imgur.com/a/9VGFuA7) (no i don't know why "don't" looks messed up)
    - Mojang can take down the mod at any time and you'd lose $5. And no, calling it a "donation to Complex" doesn't change anything in the eyes of the law.
- [**Performance issues**](https://imgur.com/a/944Gl8R), and [**even more performance issues**](https://imgur.com/bxJyO2X)
    - SBE is notorious for destroying your FPS. Their attempt at fixing it was blatantly stealing patcher FPS features.
- **Complex is a shitty human being**
    - Illegally steals other people's work that they spent hundreds of hours on and makes money off of it.

# EVEN IF YOU ALREADY BOUGHT SBE, DO NOT USE IT!

- If you already did buy it, the Sunk Cost Fallacy makes it so that you still should't use it. The money you spent is already long gone and no longer plays a factor in your decision making. Using the $5 as an excuse to continue using SBE is the irrational decision. Think of it as buying a broken spoon that barely works, and then finding a brand new working one in your drawer. There is no reason to continue using the broken spoon. Even if you do use it, you're not getting your money's worth out of it. That money was thrown away and nothing can be done about it. Same applies for SBE. Your money is gone. Remove SBE from your PC.
