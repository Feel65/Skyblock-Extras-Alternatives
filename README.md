# Reasons NOT to Buy SBE:
- [**Shitty puzzle solvers v1**](https://imgur.com/a/2xcDUBN)
- [**Crashes v1**](https://imgur.com/a/nXh749Y)
- [**Obfuscated to fuck**](https://imgur.com/a/41aSbvw) (this means we cant read the code unless we spend hours decrpying it, meaning it is really unsafe, and also that it can hide stolen code. also if you crash, no one fuckin knows why because the crashlog is just spam of iIiIiIiiIIiIiiIiIiiiIiIiIiIiiIiiiiIIIiiIiIiiIiiIiIiiIiiIiii)
- [**Spams the fuck out of your logs v1**](https://imgur.com/a/zanoqTA) (no one is going to want to help you after this)
- [**Spams the fuck out of your logs v2**](https://imgur.com/a/xQm7jeN) (i dont understand how you can fuck up this badly)
- [**Spams the fuck out of your logs v3**](https://imgur.com/a/tFODSqR) (its not even funny anymore)
- [**Spams the fuck out of your logs v4**](https://imgur.com/a/ZqTvjuf) (it's just depressing at this point)
- **Blatantly steals from DSM** (cant find screenshot but its the tic tac toe solver, it's literally the same thing)
- [**Blatantly steals from SBC**](https://imgur.com/a/TpkgDGU)
- [**Blatantly steals from Patcher**](https://imgur.com/a/rjNF5aT)
- [**Blatantly steals from NEU**](https://imgur.com/a/wqA6KZA)
- **Breaks MC EULA** - Mojang can take down the mod at any time and you'd lose $5
- **Performance issues** - SBE is notorious for destroying your FPS. Their attempt at fixing it was blatantly stealing patcher fps features.
- **Complex is a shitty human being** - illegally steals other people's work that they spent hundreds of hours on and makes money off of it.

Now that I saved you $5, consider giving that money to me instead.
